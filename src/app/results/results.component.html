<!-- I was thinking to represent the data with nested tables if it was possible or with a list inside table or a table inside list
  it will be populated with an array that will get the data with the http call

  round1      |  date     | circuit information     |
   pos1     | points      | drivername1     | constructor name
   pos2     | points      | drivername2     | constructor name
   pos3     | points      | drivername3     | constructor name

   round2      |  date     | circuit information     |
   pos21     | points      | drivername1     | constructor name
   pos22     | points      | drivername2     | constructor name
   pos23     | points      | drivername3     | constructor name

   round3      |  date     | circuit information     |
   pos31     | points      | drivername1     | constructor name
   pos32     | points      | drivername2     | constructor name
   pos33     | points      | drivername3     | constructor name
